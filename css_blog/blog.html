<h2>This Is My First Article</h2>

<p class="quote">It all happens automatically. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. In your world you can create anything you desire.</p>

<p>Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing.</p>

<p>That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's build an almighty mountain. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.</p>

<h2>This Is My Second Article</h2>

<p class="quote">This piece of canvas is your world. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.</p>

<p>No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.</p>

<p>I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.</p>
